# AWS / TypeScript / React - Todo List

## Description

_Duration: 72 hours_

The front end of this application was built with TypeScript, React (functional components with hooks), Redux, HTML5, and CSS3. While the serverless back end was built with AWS Lambda, AWS S3, AWS DynamoDB, AWS CloudWatch, and Node.

My goals for this project: 
- Solidify understanding of TypeScript 
- Build a Serverless backend with AWS 
- Practice vanilla CSS

To complete these goals I used TypeScript documentation, AWS Documentation, and a YouTube tutorial on how to start a Serverless backend with AWS.

The biggest challenge that I faced was configuring Redux with TypeScript! This was overcome by using Google, StackOverflow, and Redux documentation.

I had a lot of fun making this application and I hope you enjoy it!
